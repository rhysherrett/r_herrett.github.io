        <div class="box1">
            <p class="text">Hello my name is Rhys and this is my journey</p>

        </div>
        <div class="box2">
            <p class="text">For many years i worked as a maintenace engineer until i was made redundent.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="box3">
            <p class="text">And over time looking for work i became very depressed. A condition i have suffered with on
                and off most of my life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box4">
            <p class="text">Talking to a friend he suggusted and apparently always thought i was on the autism spectrum.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="box5">
            <p class="text">So i begain to look up autism spectrum disorder on-line and came to the realization he maybe
                right. For i have allways found after social interactions i am worn out and i look at the world in a
                very logical way. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="box6">
            <p class="text">And then in a random conversation with my mother she said if i was born in this day and age
                i would have been diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="box7">
            <p class="text">Even though i am currently undiagnosed knowing that my brain works diffrently from other
                peoples has helped me manage my depression by understanding autistic shut downs due to stress are the cause.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="box8">
            <p class="text">So depression down next was to look for new employment. I looked and looked with no luck all
                because i do not drive all the maintenace engineering jobs were miles out the way. It was impossible
                to
                get there for a 6am start as most are 12hour shifts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="box9">
            <p class="text">And localy there was only retail work which i tried and care home work but they are not for
                me.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="box10">
            <p class="text">So i begain to think what job can i do or enjoy doing from home. over the last few years i
                have done some coding just for fun but realy enjoyed the logic behind it.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="box11">
            <p class="text">So i decided to do a full course, and get qualified in Front End Website Design/Development and Data Analysis</p>

        </div>
        <div class="box12">
